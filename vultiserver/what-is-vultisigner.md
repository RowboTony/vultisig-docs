# What is a Vultisigner

Vultisigner (also known as Vultiserver) is a feature of Vultisig that allows for the automatic co-signing of transactions within a user's Vault, but only under pre-defined parameters set by the Vault owner. \
It acts as an automatic co-signer that engages only when specific user-defined criterias are met.

This functionality allows users to manage a Vultisig vault that inherently operates as a multi-device, multi-factor vault while providing the user experience of a single-signature wallet when signing transactions. Particularly in a 2-of-2 Fast Vault configuration. \
When used in a 2-of-3 Active Vault setup, it significantly enhances security due to the added transaction policies.&#x20;

Therefore the Vultisigner feature ensures that funds undergo automatic security checks that are consistently met once configured. These features can be modified by obtaining the threshold majority of vault shares and signing a transaction, offering flexibility in maintaining and updating security protocols.
