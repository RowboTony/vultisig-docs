# Signing a Transaction

## Get your device's ready

Depending on your Vault type (2-of-2, 2-of-3, 3-of-4, or m-of-n), you need to have the threshold number of devices ready for the signing process.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember: One device is creating the transaction, and the other device is your "verification" device. You need to "pair" the devices to each other to exchange the transaction information.

Make sure you confirm the transaction on your pair device.

Both devices will co-sign and send the final transaction. Only one transaction will be sent (you won't have duplicate transactions).

On the Pair screen, a QR code will be generated. \
Choose the correct option: whether your other devices are in the same **Wi-Fi** or using The relay Server over the **Internet**.

That's it! The transaction should sign and be sent by one of the devices.
