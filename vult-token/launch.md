# Launch of $VULT (Status: **Launch Date Pending**)

> **Last updated:** 2025‑04‑21 - reflects the “Token Launch Update and New Principles for Community Communication” Medium post. [Read the full announcement](https://vultisig.medium.com/token-launch-update-and-new-principles-for-community-communication-a57898b5614e).

## TL;DR / FAQ

 **Launch window:** *TBA*. The DEX launch will occur **24 hours *before* our CEX listing**, once the CEX partner publicly confirms their go-live date. We will share this confirmation as soon as we receive it - which could be announced several days or weeks ahead of time.
- **DEX → CEX cadence:** 24 h DEX lead‑in, then CEX listing (same model, just date now gated on CEX confirmation).
- **Liquidity & pricing:** unchanged - 35% of supply seeded in a Uniswap V3 pool at ~$3M FDV.
- **Whitelist:** unchanged - 1,500 slots with staggered purchase caps ($1k first hour → $10k thereafter).
- **IOU VULT holders:** merged IOU balances will be airdropped as *staked VULT* **24h after public launch**; no action required.

## Why the delay?

Our CEX partners determine their own go‑live schedule. Once our CEX partner publicly confirms their listing schedule, we will coordinate transparently and clearly communicate the DEX launch date. Committing prematurely has already created confusion, so we are moving to an evidence‑based timeline:

1. **CEX confirms listing date** (signed & sealed).
2. We subtract 24 h from the confirmed CEX listing date and lock that in as the DEX launch time - meaning you’ll know the DEX launch timing as soon as the CEX date is announced.
3. Announcement to the community within 24h of receiving the confirmation.
4. Joint marketing push‑up with the CEX + Vultisquad until launch.

This approach guarantees we never miss a published date again and keeps the community first in the information flow.

### Pool Composition

## Communication Principles (adopted 2025‑04‑21)

1. **Evidence over estimation** - no public dates without contractual confirmation.
2. **Community first** - Vultisquad gets the news before press releases.
3. **Single source of truth** - this page is updated within 24h of any material change.
