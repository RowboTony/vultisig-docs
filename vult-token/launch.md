# Launch of $VULT

## TLDR/FAQ

* **Launch**: April 23, 2025, on Ethereum (Uniswap V3)
* **Initial Pool**: 35% of VULT tokens
* **Pricing**: $3M starting FDV
* **Format**: 24-hour whitelist period (1,500 users) then public launch
* **Purchase Limits**: Hour 1: $1,000 max per whitelist; Hour 2+: $10,000 max
* **Fees**: 1% swap fee on Uniswap V3 pool

## Launch Liquidity

### **Initial Funding**

Vultisig has raised $3.6 million from outside investors. A portion of this capital will be used to pair against the $VULT tokens in a UNI V3 liquidity pool. By using the concentrated liquidity and range setting of UNI V3, the capital will be deployed in a range of $3 million to $1 billion FDV.\
This will allow for the efficient use of capital and the deployment of capital in the areas necessary to efficiently manage the token on launch day.

### Liquidity&#x20;

The initial launch pool will consist of 35% of all $VULT tokens

* 24% of $VULT tokens are provided from initial investors
* 11% of $VULT tokens come from the project Treasury

### **Initial Valuation**

This setup gives us the possibility to launch at a **fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $3 million**.

## Launch Plan

While prioritizing development sustainability, we remain deeply committed to fair token distribution. In line with this commitment, we’re honoring our previously announced plan with an initial WL launch at **$3M fully diluted valuation** (FDV).

### Date and Launch Platform

The VULT launch will occur on the **23rd of April 2025** on **Ethereum mainnet** through a seeded Uniswap V3 liquidity pool, accessible via:

* Our dedicated Vultisig launch website
* Directly through the Uniswap interface

The launch will proceed in two structured phases to ensure orderly market formation and maximize participation opportunities.

### **Whitelisted Trade-Only Period**

Our first launch phase gives 1,500 early Vultisig supporters priority access through a whitelist for **24 hours.** These early believers were hand selected and will receive first access to the $VULT token with significant benefits:

* Priority purchase rights of up to \~$10,000 in ETH equivalent per whitelist position
* Starting at $3M FDV
* Complete freedom to sell tokens at their discretion, with no lockup requirements
* Participation alongside our investors who may also sell tokens or provide liquidity during this phase. Specified here.

#### Dedicated to good distribution&#x20;

Our hand-selected whitelist process already significantly limits bot impact, as we've carefully vetted participants to prioritize genuine community members. \
While we want to maintain an open trading environment with minimal restrictions, we've implemented a balanced approach that protects our launch integrity.\
The two-tier allocation system works as follows:

* **Hour 1**: Whitelist participants can purchase up to $1,000 worth of $VULT
* **Hour 2 onward**: Full access to complete \~$10,000 allocation

This staggered approach prevents automated systems from front-running transactions to acquire large positions immediately at launch. By carefully vetting participants and implementing measured purchase limits, we create a more equitable environment for our community while establishing healthy initial token distribution and liquidity.

### **Public Launch**

After 24 hours, the whitelist phase will conclude, and we’ll transition to our public launch. At this point, the $VULT token pool will be fully opened to everyone, removing all purchase restrictions. During this phase:

* Anyone can buy, sell, or provide liquidity without limits
* No maximum purchase amounts or throttling mechanisms will be in place
* Full market dynamics will determine price discovery
