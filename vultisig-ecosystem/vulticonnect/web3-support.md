# Web3 support

The Vultisig Extension aims to support all dApps and interfaces where a wallet connection is possible.\
It either is natively integrated or allows connections via other wallet injections if dedicated Vultisig Extension support is unavailable.

As we add more chains supported by the Vultisig Extension, we will also constantly expand connectivity to the whole web3 space. \
\
This it the current list of supported dApps and interfaces:
