# Web3 support

Vultisig Extension aims to support all dApps and interfaces where a wallet connection is possible.&#x20;

With Vultisig Extension adding more chain support, we aim to expand the connectivity constantly. Furthermore it allows to connect via injections if a dedicated Vultisig Extension support is not available.\
\
This it the current list of supported dApps and interfaces:
