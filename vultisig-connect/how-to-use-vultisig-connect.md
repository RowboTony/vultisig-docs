## How to import a Vault

## How to connect to web3

## How to sign transactions

Signing a transaction with Vultisig Connect is seamless.\
\
Construct the desired transaction on the interface of your choice.\
When initiating a transaction, Vultisig Connect will open and present a verification screen to verify the correctness of the initiated transaction.

Continuing, you will see a QR code that contains all the information needed for your Vultisig Vault to sign the transaction.\
\
Scan the QR with your vault devices.\
\
If the threshold for signing is reached, the transaction will be signed automatically.

Vulticonnect only have users' public key information, not the actual vault shares. Thus Vulticonnect itself cannot be a signer.
