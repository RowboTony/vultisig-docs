# Vultisig Referrals

## What are Vultisig Referrals

Vultisig Referrals uses the [THORChain Nested affiliates](https://dev.thorchain.org/affiliate-guide/affiliate-fee-guide.html) feature to redistribute some Vultisig swap fees directly to users.

## What do Vultisig users gain?

* Referrers gain 10 basis points on all swaps that occur through their referral.
* Those using referrals save 5 basis points on each swap.

## How do they work?

When a swap is made, the app creates a memo for the swap on THORChain. This memo includes the user's chosen affiliate and redistributes the fees directly to the affiliate's owner.

## How to manage the Vultisig Referrals

Referrals can be accessed in the settings of the Vultisig app.\
There are three options:

1. Create your own referral and start earning.
2. Save a referral and start saving.
3. Edit your saved referral
